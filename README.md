<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

It is a Yoga pose Classification App which will detect amongst five yoga classes i.e., ['Downdog', 'Goddess', 'Plank', 'Tree', 'Warrior2']

This is my NAVTTC FYP for the course of AI(Machine Learning and Deep Learning). I got the inspiration to create this project due to following:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a Deep Learning model.
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one-Knowledge will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this Project!
